# Dart OOP Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains a Dart assignment that demonstrates various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including:

- **Encapsulation**: Hides sensitive data and provides controlled access.
- **Inheritance**: Shows how subclasses inherit properties and methods from a superclass.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrates method overriding for different implementations in subclasses.
- **Abstraction**: Uses abstract classes and methods to enforce implementation in subclasses.

## Files

- **`encapsulation.dart`**: Contains an example of encapsulation with private fields and public getters/setters.
- **`inheritance.dart`**: Demonstrates inheritance with a base `Animal` class and `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses.
- **`polymorphism.dart`**: Shows polymorphism with method overriding for different types of `Bird`.
- **`abstraction.dart`**: Implements abstraction using abstract classes and methods for `Shape`, `Rectangle`, and `Circle`.
